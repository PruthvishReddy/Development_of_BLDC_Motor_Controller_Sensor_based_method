Sensor-Based BLDC Motor Controller
This repository contains the code, design files, and documentation for the development of a sensor-based Brushless DC (BLDC) motor controller. The project aims to design, implement, and evaluate a BLDC motor controller tailored for a specific application, assuming a sensor-based control approach.

Features
Sensor Feedback: Utilizes sensor feedback for accurate control of the BLDC motor.
Closed-Loop Control: Implements closed-loop control algorithms for precise speed and position control.
Fault Detection: Includes fault detection mechanisms to ensure safe operation of the motor.
Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Hardware:
BLDC motor
Microcontroller or development board (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
Hall-effect sensors or other position sensors
Motor driver circuitry
Software:
MatLab
Installing
[Insert installation instructions here, including any necessary setup or configuration steps.]
Usage
To use the sensor-based BLDC motor controller in your project or application, follow these steps:

[Initialization]: Initialize the motor controller and configure the sensor inputs.
[Control]: Implement control algorithms to set the desired speed or position of the motor.
[Feedback]: Monitor sensor feedback to ensure accurate control and detect any faults.
[Safety]: Implement safety measures to handle unexpected situations or faults.
